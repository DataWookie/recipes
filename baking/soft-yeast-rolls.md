# Soft Yeast Rolls

## Ingredients

- 1 cup whole milk (lower fat milk can be substituted)
- 1 package (0.25 oz or 2 1/2 tsp) active dry (not instant or rapid rise)
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup (5 1/2 TBSP, 2.6oz, 73gr) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- 4 cups (17oz, 476gr) all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 2 TBSP water

## Method

1. Heat the milk until it starts to bubble. Let cool for 10 minutes.
2. Add the yeast to the milk and stir together. Allow to stand for 5 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, rub butter into flour. Add the sugar, eggs and salt. Add the milk/yeast mixture. Stir together.
4. Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn to coat, cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place.
6. Beat down dough. Allow to rise again. [You can refrigerate at this stage.]
7. Divide dough into 12 pieces. Shape the pieces into balls. Grease a bread tin and space the balls evenly. [You can refrigerate at this stage.]
8. Make an egg wash by whisking the egg with the water. Brush the rolls with the egg wash.
10. Bake at 180 Â°C for 14-20 minutes.

Note: If you refrigerate then allow time for dough to come to room temperature.
